# Literature-Review-Visualizations-
## Objective
This code generates maps that display the regions and countries covered in our literature review. It also produces a map highlighting the most frequently explored themes by region.

## About the Literature Review
This project examines global narratives of democracy. We conducted a systematic literature review covering both academic and gray sources to understand how democracy is discussed, and to analyze the messaging and narratives that emerge in the context of weakening institutions and strengthening authoritarianism worldwide.

**Data**
The visualizations are based on primary data that we produced through our own documentation of the papers and documents included in the review.
